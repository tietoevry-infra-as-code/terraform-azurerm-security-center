# Security Center Terraform module

Azure Security Center is a unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your data centers and provides advanced threat protection across your hybrid workloads in the cloud. This module helps you to create Azure Security Center resources for Azure Landing Zones.

Security Center collects data from the Azure virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets, IaaS containers, and non-Azure (including on-premises) computers to monitor for security vulnerabilities and threats. Data is collected using the `Log Analytics agent`, which reads various security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and copies the data to the workspace for analysis.  Data collected by Security Center stored in __Log Analytics workspace(s)__.

## Module Usage

```hcl
module "security-center" {
  source  = "kumarvna/security-center/azurerm"
  version = "1.0.0"

  # Resource Group, location, log analytics details
  # One or more email addresses seperated by commas
  resource_group_name          = "rg-shared-westeurope-01"
  log_analytics_workspace_name = "loganalytics-we-sharedtest"

  # Subscription Security Center contacts
  # One or more email addresses seperated by commas
